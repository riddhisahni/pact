# PACT - A self-care social media app

## Submission for HackMIT 2024

## Inspiration
Our app was inspired the popular Internet challenge “75 Hard”, a mental toughness challenge where users commit to following a set of rules: 2 workouts, drinking a gallon of water, reading 10 pages, following a diet, etc.. Over time people have adopted their own personal variations of this challenge, changing the rules to align with their own fitness/lifestyle goals. However, it is still difficult for people to hold themselves accountable and people often fail the challenge before completing it. Our app allows users to complete and document their own personalized “75 hard” challenge , establishing a sense of social accountability and group motivation.

## What it does
Pact is a mental and physical wellness social media platform where groups of friends commit to a personalized “75 hard” challenge, documenting their progress throughout daily posts and updates. Users can create groups with their friends who are also on the app and establish their set of goals or “pacts”, such as the length of the challenge and the pacts that are to be completed daily. Once a group is established, users provide daily updates to their friends on the progress of the completion of their pacts throughout posting images and updating a checklist. Users can view their progress compared with other members of the group with a leaderboard that displays the amount of days each person successfully completes their pacts. Overall, Pact seeks to improve user’s mental and physical health by providing a source of consistent accountability and an element of fun and social interaction!

## How we built it
We built the front-end with React, back-end with Convex and utilized Clerk for user login and authentication.

## What's next
We want to expand our project by converting this application to a mobile app, both in form and with additional accessories like personalized widgets and a notification system. We want this app to be an easy and efficient way to log our progress, made most accessible through a phone application. We would use React Native to achieve this goal. In addition, we want to create a calendar in which users can iterate through different days to recover/see the goals/pictures they previously achieved. This calendar tab would also allow users to see their friends/communities' previous activities. We want to add a community page, where we are able to see other people like friends of friends' progress, a task we want to do by having a more sophisitcated usage of our database. Lastly, want to add the logo to our application to make a better UI.
